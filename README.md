# Pizza_Price_Prediction
This project involves predicting pizza prices based on size using a linear regression model. The goal was to analyze the relationship between pizza size (in inches) and price, using a simple and interpretable machine learning model. The model was developed in Python, leveraging scikit-learn for training and matplotlib for visualizing the results.
